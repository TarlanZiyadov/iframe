        <p>Let's start with 'Test'. What's mean 'Test'? You may read about QA, Tester, Test Engineer and so on. Those persons may test software or hardware depend on how product 
        looks or feels like but it's not necesserly to be a product you must interact with perhaps asking a question may be a part of test in case to verify your thougts or requirements 
        that the product may have implemented or not. In some case will be implemented in further development it's depends on situation. Test can be subjective perhaps every tester think, feel, understand
        different as human being. You may heard or read about Test Automation Engineer or Automation of test and so on. You can find many different names for different Test work.
        As I tried explane short I mean very short since Test or Testing is very big area in IT and have been written many books about so recommend to read some of them to at least understand who is tester
        and what do a tester do or how testing can be done 'Google for help'(maybe in some other blog I will share some books or articles which I been reading). So who is or what a Test Automation
        Engineer does? As I said in the beginning of this blog, asking a question to verify requirement can be a part of test and in this case as a tester you dont know the answer before
        you ask a question but as Test Automation Engineer you know answer before you ask a question. Sounds weird right? Because you want to get the answer you know alredy
        you know which question to ask. Difference is as Test Automation Engineer your questioning
        a product not human being. A product that not talk a languange we use to and understand only a programming language. Since you know the answers then its not a question anymore it's 
        becoming a checking. When you know the answer why to ask a product that can't think as human? You can save time and act instead by checking the answers. Automation the answers by checking them
        is how can be Test Automation named. But it's not so simple as its sounds like. First you have to choose which answers you want to get and ask yourself are those answers exists in the 
        product if not should they exists or not? As you see you need to know product well before your will check answers and thats mean product must be ready for checking and have those 
        answers you will be expecting later in your checking or test automation. Then why its called for Test Automation? Well, since you will check many answers and those answers will be expanding with
        time the you want to know that you will get the same answer for your first question all the time even if answer list is getting bigger even if there 1000 other answers. Since this blog is about
        Test Automation not about technical testing therefor I will tell about how to start with automation in next blog! Of course my thoughts is only subjective and may not be same as yours as well as how you see the Test Automation.
